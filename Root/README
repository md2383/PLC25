Directions on building the project in a Linux environment for the cs machines.


1) Navigate to the Root directory: cd $/(path)/(to)/(Root)
    All the following should be run from the root (the same directory this README is in)

2) Compile the Java files. Make sure you include the [ -d . ] option to specify 
    the current directory as the root for the package structure:

    > [ javac -d . "(find src -name "*.java")" ]

3) To run the program, you must do one of the following:

    PHASE 1:
    To run the JottTokenizerTester class; you need to specify the correct
    package name, and to specify the classpath explicitly.

    > [ java testers.JottTokenizerTester ]

    PHASE 2:
    To run the JottParserTester class; you need to specify the correct 
    package name, and to specify the classpath explicitly.

    > [ java testers.JottParserTester ]

    PHASE 3:
    To run the main method; the program must have a Jott file input as a command line argument.

    > [ java Jott input.jott ]

    Where input.jott is any generic jott file ( assumed to be on the same file level as Jott.java )



NOTE:   If you are debugging/testing, make sure you enable assertions. 
        Debugging/Testing also requires the exterior test case packages.
        This should ONLY be used for testing, and not on the final version for each phase.
        The correct tag/vmArg is: -ea

        PHASE 1:
        > [ java -ea -cp . testers.JottTokenizerTester ]
        PHASE 2:
        > [ java -ea -cp . testers.JottParserTester ]
        PHASE 3:
        > [ java -ea JottValidTester ]
        > [ java -ea Jott input.jott ]
